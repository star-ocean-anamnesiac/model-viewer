# model-viewer
A model viewer for all characters in Star Ocean: Anamnesis

## Notes

TODO: how to extract models?

All FBX files exported by SOA are version 6100, and need to be converted to 7100.

TODO: convert to GLB (?) to display in threejs? This format should have all animations and textures included?
